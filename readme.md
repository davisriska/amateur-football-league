#What is this?

This is an Amateur football league administration application.
It`s built using PHP Framework [Laravel](http://laravel.com/).

After cloning/downloading it. 

Run `composer install`.

For database migrations `php artisan migrate`.

And there is a database seed that you can run with `php artisan db:seed`.
This will make a default user with `admin@admin.com` and password `admin123`.
And it will make some fake database data.
